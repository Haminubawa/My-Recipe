                <ol>
                    <li>Soak the beans in water for about 30 minutes to soften the skins.</li>
                    <li>After soaking, remove the skins by rubbing the beans together in water and rinsing repeatedly until they are clean and skinless.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the cleaned beans in a blender, adding a small amount of water to create a smooth, thick paste.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add spices (such as pepper and onions) to the blender for additional flavor. Blend until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the blended beans paste to a bowl and add salt and seasonings. Mix well to ensure even distribution.
                    </li>
                    <li>Heat palm oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium heat until hot.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using a spoon, scoop small portions of the bean mixture and carefully drop them into the hot oil.</li>
                    <li>Fry each side for about 3-5 minutes or until the bean cakes are golden brown.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the bean cakes from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot as a snack or breakfast item, often enjoyed with a side of pap (corn porridge) or a spicy pepper sauce.
                    </li>

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven and grease a cake pan with a bit of butter or line it with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This helps to give the cake a good texture.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add the milk and continue to mix until itâ€™s well combined with the butter and sugar.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the flour to the wet ingredients, mixing gently with a spoon or spatula. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add small amounts of water as needed to achieve a smooth, thick, but pourable batter. You may not need the entire 1000 ml of water; add just enough to get the right consistency.</li>
                    <li>Pour the butter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly.</li>
                    <li>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>Once baked, allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve your homemade cake!</li>
