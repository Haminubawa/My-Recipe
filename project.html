                    Core (CORE) is a cryptocurrency native to the Core DAO ecosystem, 
                    which operates on a blockchain designed to balance decentralization, 
                    scalability, and security. The Core blockchain employs a unique consensus
                     mechanism called "Satoshi Plus," which combines Proof of Work (PoW) with
                      Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to leverage both security and efficiency.

                        Notcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created as a satirical take on the abundance 
                        of coins and tokens in the crypto space, aiming to highlight the humorous side of 
                        digital currencies. Although itâ€™s intended to be playful, Notcoin has gained a small
                         community of enthusiasts who treat it as a meme coin, similar to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.

                            Dogs (DOGS) is a cryptocurrency often associated with the meme coin culture,
                             similar to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. DOGS tokens are typically designed to be 
                             community-driven and emphasize fun, community engagement, and social media hype. 
                             While there isn't one universally recognized "Dogs" coin, there are several 
                             community-created projects involving dog themes, each with unique characteristics 
                             and ecosystems.
