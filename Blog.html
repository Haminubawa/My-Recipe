                I have learned how the web works and built foundational skills in HTML,
                 CSS, and JavaScript to create basic websites. You also explored development
                  tools like code editors, browser developer tools, and Git for efficient coding 
                  and collaboration.

                I have learned the basics of UI/UX design, focusing on creating user-friendly and visually
                 appealing interfaces. You also practiced using design tools to prototype and refine digital
                  experiences based on user feedback.

            <h2>Course 3:Learning HTML Basics and CSS Styling</h2>
            <p><em>Date: November 2, 2024</em></p>
            <p>Today, I started learning HTML, the structure of web pages. I learned about tags, elements,
                 and how to create paragraphs, headers, and lists. I also practiced creating links and adding images.
                  It's exciting to finally see how web pages are put together!I moved on to CSS, which is all about
                   styling. I learned how to change colors, set background images, and adjust the font size and style.
                    I also practiced using selectors and combining classes with IDs. CSS is really powerful for
                     customizing the look of a web page!
